# About Me
My name is Anusha Khobare, and I am currently in 11th grade. Last year, I took the AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) course, which fueled my passion for technology and programming. This year, I am excited to be taking AP Computer Science A (CSA) to further develop my skills in software development and algorithms.

I have experience in several technologies, including JavaScript, HTML, SCSS, and SQLite databases. I'm always eager to learn more and apply my knowledge to real-world projects.

The freeform picture includes books because I love to read. It also includes music because I like to listen to music. I added a picture of the beach because I live in San Diego and love to go to the beach. I included a picture of strawberry ice cream for food because it is my favorite food.

# Past CSP Projects

## Project 1: Fitness Tracker

**Description:** This project started as a simple fitness tracker and eventually evolved into a comprehensive health tracking application.

- **Water Tracking:** Developed a feature for tracking water intake using a moving bar.
- **Food Tracker:** Implemented a food tracking system that stores user data in local storage and generates a health score by comparing user intake with USDA recommended values. This feature includes pie charts to help users visualize the difference between their intake and recommended values.
- **Enhanced with ML:** Integrated a `food.csv` dataset from Kaggle connected to an SQLite backend. This enhancement provided ML-based suggestions for fruit and vegetable intake based on user lifestyle.
- **Expanded Features:** The final version of the project included additional trackers for sleep, fitness, and stress, as well as a profile creation feature for personalized tracking.

**Technologies Used:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Local Storage, D3.js (for pie charts), SQLite, Python (for ML algorithms)  
**Backend Repository:** [GitHub Repository](#)  
**Frontend Link:** [Live Demo](#)

## Project 2: Calorie Burned Calculator

**Description:** This project is a calorie burned calculator developed using the Seaborn library. Initially developed in Jupyter Notebooks, it was later implemented in a model and API form.

- **Data Processing:** Included one-hot encoding, data cleaning (dropping blank data values in the table), training the data, and making predictions.
- **Backend:** Similar to the ML capabilities of the fitness tracker, this project also featured an SQLite backend with GET and POST requests.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Seaborn, Pandas, Scikit-learn, SQLite, Flask (for API)  
**Backend Repository:** [GitHub Repository](#)  
**Frontend Repository:** [GitHub Repository](#)

## Project 3: Third Trimester Museum Project

**Description:** This project combined elements from two previous triangle projects. My contribution focused on developing a system for sorting and searching through an array of exercise cards.

- **Exercise Cards:** Implemented a feature for sorting and searching exercise cards based on editable attributes like likes and intensity.
- **Backend:** Utilized an SQLite database for storing and retrieving exercise card data.

**Technologies Used:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQLite
