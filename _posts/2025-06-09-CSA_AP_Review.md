| Study Plan + Resources       | Added Below     |

| Day  | Focus Area                                    | Action                                                      |
|------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Day 1 | Quick Review of Core Concepts                | Review primitive data types, control flow, arrays/ArrayLists. Solve 1-2 FRQs on basic syntax and arrays. |
| Day 2 | Quick Review of Core Concepts                | Continue reviewing primitive structures, control flow, arrays. Solve 1-2 more FRQs focusing on these areas. |
| Day 3 | Recursion Basics                             | Study recursion fundamentals and common problems (factorial, Fibonacci). Solve 3-4 FRQs on recursion. |
| Day 4 | Recursion Basics                             | Continue practicing recursion with more complex problems. Solve 3-4 additional FRQs on recursion. |
| Day 5 | Arrays, ArrayLists & Recursion               | Solve 3-4 FRQs that combine recursion with arrays/ArrayLists (e.g., search, reverse). |
| Day 6 | Arrays, ArrayLists & Recursion               | Practice more FRQs that require array manipulation and recursion. Focus on optimizing solutions. |
| Day 7 | Advanced Recursion and Algorithms            | Study recursive sorting algorithms (merge sort, quicksort) and binary search. Solve 3-4 FRQs on complex recursion. |
| Day 8 | Advanced Recursion and Algorithms            | Continue solving FRQs on recursive algorithms, focusing on binary search and sorting. |
| Day 9 | Practice with Mixed FRQs                     | Solve 4-5 FRQs that combine arrays, ArrayLists, and recursion. Focus on problem-solving. |
| Day 10| Practice with Mixed FRQs                     | Work on 4-5 more mixed FRQs. Review solutions for efficiency and accuracy. |
| Day 11| Full-Length AP CSA FRQs                      | Complete a timed practice exam (2-3 hours). Review mistakes, focus on recursion-heavy problems. |
| Day 12| Full-Length AP CSA FRQs                      | Take another timed practice exam. Review the FRQs you struggled with and identify patterns. |
| Day 13| Mock Exam with Focus on Weak Areas           | Focus on specific weak areas (e.g., advanced recursion or complex arrays). Take a timed practice exam or targeted FRQs. |
| Day 14| Final Review                                 | Light review of key concepts. Solve a couple of FRQs, relax and rest. |
