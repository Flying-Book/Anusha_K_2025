### AI (Deprecated Files)
- Files that were originally worked on to provide AI parsing via Open AI instead of manual parsing 
- Would allow for more message flexibility in slack (no longer need templates)
- Scraped due to time + money issues
- Tested with a Personal Open AI token (further testing + school token needed for main implementation
- Alternate AI APIS (LLMs) researched
    - Llama -> complicated model; does not respond well to message parsing
    - Gemini -> needs python to run; maybe python plug in (future CSA class of 2026 could explore)
- Mirrors old version of Calendar Event files with critical changes in parsing strategy and data storage in multiple files

**N@TM Feedback** 
- Develop a feedback system for the Slack bot to provide users with
error messages when syntax errors occur (e.g., using curly braces {}
instead of square brackets []).
- Additionally, the system should offer
suggestions for correct syntax to improve usability.
- Expand message processing capabilities to support additional
structures, such as allowing users to add events for an entire week in
a single request.
