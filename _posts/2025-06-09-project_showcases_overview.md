## Showcasing Our Work: From HP Expo to N@tM June 2025

### HP Expo
At the HP Expo, we demonstrated the core features of Slack-Calendar, focusing on its ability to:
- Automatically parse messages using a consistent template
- Support editing, deleting, and adding events
- UI design (colored assigments generated events)
- Connection to other toolkit features

**Loved:**
- Liked the connection with other toolkit featues
Suggestions:
- Update UI
- Add reminders sidebar feature
