## Slack Events Breakdown 
Overview

This system is designed to manage calendar events extracted from Slack messages. It processes incoming messages, extracts relevant event details, stores them in a database, and provides RESTful API endpoints for event management. The system is built using Java with Spring Boot and integrates with Slack for automated event parsing and notifications.

### Components

**1. Entity: CalendarEvent** 
- Represents an event in the system.
- Fields 
     - [ ] id: Unique identifier for the event.
     - [ ] date: Date of the event.
     - [ ] title: Title of the event.
     - [ ] description: Additional details about the event.
     - [ ] type: Classification of the event (e.g., general, check-in, grade).
     - [ ] period: Period during which the event occurs.
- Uses JPA annotations for ORM mapping.
**2. Repository: CalendarEventRepository**
- Extends JpaRepository to interact with the database.
- Provides methods for querying events:
     - [ ] findByDate(LocalDate date): Fetch events by a specific date.
     - [ ] findByDateBetween(LocalDate startDate, LocalDate endDate): Fetch events within a date range.
     - [ ] findByType(String type): Fetch events by type.
     - [ ] findByTitle(String title): Fetch event by title.
**3. Service: CalendarEventService**
- Business logic layer handling event management.
- Methods include:
     - [ ] saveEvent(CalendarEvent event): Saves an event to the database.
     - [ ] getEventsByDate(LocalDate date): Retrieves events for a specific date.
     - [ ] updateEventByTitle(String title, String newTitle, String description): Updates an event’s title and description.
     - [ ] deleteEventByTitle(String title): Deletes an event by title.
     - [ ] getEventsWithinDateRange(LocalDate startDate, LocalDate endDate): Fetches events within a given range.
     - [ ] parseSlackMessage(Map<String, String> jsonMap, LocalDate weekStartDate): Parses Slack messages and creates corresponding events.
     - [ ] extractEventsFromText(String text, LocalDate weekStartDate): Uses regex to extract event details from Slack messages.
**4. Controller: CalendarEventController**
- Exposes REST API endpoints for managing calendar events.
- Endpoints:
     - [ ] POST /api/calendar/add: Parses Slack messages and creates events.
     - [ ] POST /api/calendar/add_event: Adds an event manually.
     - [ ] GET /api/calendar/events/{date}: Retrieves events for a given date.
     - [ ] DELETE /api/calendar/delete/{title}: Deletes an event by title.
     - [ ] PUT /api/calendar/edit/{title}: Updates an event’s title and description.
     - [ ] GET /api/calendar/events: Fetches all events.
     - [ ] GET /api/calendar/events/range?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD: Fetches events within a date range.
     - [ ] GET /api/calendar/events/next-day: Retrieves events for the next day.
### Workflow
**- Event Creation:**
     - Slack messages are sent to the /api/calendar/add endpoint.
     - The CalendarEventService extracts and saves events.
     - Events can also be manually added via /api/calendar/add_event.
**- Event Retrieval:**
     - Users can fetch events by date, type, or within a date range.
**- Event Modification:**
     - Events can be updated or deleted using respective endpoints.
**Slack Integration:**
     - Events parsed from Slack messages are stored in the system.
     - Event updates trigger Slack notifications.
### Technologies Used
- Spring Boot: Backend framework.
- Spring Data JPA: Database interaction.
- Hibernate: ORM for database handling.
- Slack API: Integration for parsing and notifying about events.
- REST API: Exposes endpoints for event management.
#### Future Enhancements
- Implement authentication and authorization.
- Improve natural language processing for better Slack message parsing.
- Add event recurrence support.
- Enhance the UI for event management.
