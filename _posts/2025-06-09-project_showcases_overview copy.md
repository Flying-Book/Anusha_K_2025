## Showcasing Our Work: From HP Expo to N@tM June 2025

### HP Expo
At the HP Expo, we demonstrated the core features of Slack-Calendar, focusing on its ability to:
- Automatically parse messages using a consistent template
- Support editing, deleting, and adding events
- UI design (colored assigments generated events)
- Connection to other toolkit features

**Loved:**
- Liked the connection with other toolkit featues
Suggestions:
- Update UI
- Add reminders sidebar feature

### N@tM June 2025
**Loved:**
- The intuitive interface
- rich formatting ability

**Suggestions:**
- Integrate Gemini AI to help parse more casual or unstructured messages into calendar events.
- Expand functionality to other platforms like Discord or even email clients, making Slack-Calendar more universal.

### Past N@tM: Inspiration & Growth
Earlier N@tM events were instrumental in shaping our project. Key takeaways and feedback from these past showings inspired us to:
- Add full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for calendar events
- Introduce colored labels for different types of assignments and events
- Support richer parsing, allowing for more expressive and user-friendly formatting
